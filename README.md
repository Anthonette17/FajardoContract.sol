The contract TheNumberGame is a simple game where players guess a number. If the guessed number matches the target number set by the game owner, the game ends.
The TheNumberGame contract is a simple guessing game with controlled state changes. It uses Solidity's require, assert, and revert functions to enforce rules and ensure the contract behaves correctly. The game owner has special privileges to set the target number, and the game can only end once a correct guess is made.
